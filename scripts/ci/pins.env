# BOX64_TAR        | https://.../box64-wow64-aarch64-<ver>.tar.zst | <sha256>
# WINE_WOW64_TAR   | https://.../wine-wow64-minimal-<ver>.tar.zst  | <sha256>
# DXVK_TAR         | https://.../dxvk-<ver>.tar.xz                 | <sha256>
# FAudio_TAR       | https://.../faudio-<ver>.tar.xz               | <sha256>
# STEAMCMD_WIN_ZIP | https://steamcdn.../steamcmd.zip              | <sha256>
#
# Notes:
# - Files are downloaded to staging/downloads and verified by sha256.
# - During pack, generic archives are unpacked into the build tree, then normalized under runtime/.
# - STEAMCMD_WIN_ZIP is additionally extracted straight into:
#       staging/overlay/runtime/wine64/drive_c/steamcmd
#   so the artifact already contains Windows SteamCMD in the right place.
